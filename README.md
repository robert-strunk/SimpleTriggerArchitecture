# SimpleTriggerArchitecture
SimpleTrigger Architecture is the result of me stumbling across the System.TriggerOperation enumeration that was introduced in Salesforce Apex API version 43.0. At first I was just tinkering with it but then decided to build my take on a Salesforce trigger architecture. This does not include any features for recursion prevention or disabling triggers (although both would be very easy to add). Usage is very easy and is explained in the readme.
