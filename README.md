# SimpleTriggerArchitecture
SimpleTriggerArchitecture is the result of me stumbling across the System.TriggerOperation enumeration that was introduced in Salesforce Apex API version 43.0. At first I was just tinkering with it but then decided to take on a Salesforce trigger architecture. This does not include any features for recursion prevention or disabling triggers (although both would be very easy to add). The source code includes a custom object named Transaction__c. An example trigger along with all the necessary subclasses are also included. A more in depth readme will be added soon.
